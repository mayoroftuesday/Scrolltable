 - overall: use map or filter array functions?

 - any way to optimize "store table"?

 - speed up "set widths"
   - allow optional "set widths"
   - only set widths on every nth row, where n = scrollRows

 - why is there time delay between init and Draw()?

 - speed up "crop"?
    - possibility: instead of crop, create new table element
      - use push child and pop child to add cells from the master table?
      - if in user control, server can do initial crop
